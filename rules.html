1. Standard chess rules apply, with the alteration of:
    • the determination of checkmate/stalemate must account for the new piece rook-pawn, and the new moves
    explode, shoot, pawnify, fort, and stargate. The move teleport is ignored for the purposes of determining
    checkmate/stalemate.

2. Explode: A player may cast explode on their own knight or queen.
    • If cast upon a knight, the knight explodes (and is removed), displacing all non-king pieces in the sur-
    rounding squares backwards one square radially. Any pieces sent off the board or to a non-empty square

    are removed. The kings are unaffected by an explosion.
    • If cast upon a queen, then the queen explodes (and is removed) in a line, which is either the horizontal,
    vertical, or one of the two diagonals containing the queen (the player chooses which line). All pieces on
    this line are destroyed and removed, with the exception of both kings.
    • The queen cannot explode until she has moved at least once.

3. Shoot A player may cast shoot on one of their own bishops and a diagonally adjacent pawn/knight of their
colour.
    • If cast upon a bishop and pawn, the pawn is shot outwards from the bishop along the diagonal. If it
    collides with any piece, the pawn and the piece in question are removed (if the piece is a king, the king
    is not removed and is unaffected). If the pawn does not collide with any piece before leaving the board,
    it is simply removed from the game.
    • If cast upon a bishop and a knight, the knight is shot outwards from the bishop along the diagonal. If
    it collides with any piece, the piece in question is removed and replaced by the knight, whereupon the
    knight explodes, exactly as described before. If the removed piece was a king, it is then replaced. If the
    knight does not collide with any piece before leaving the board, it is simply removed from the game.

4. Pawnify: If the rook of a player is one square behind a pawn of their own colour, they may cast pawnify on
the rook. The pawn is removed from the game and the rook is promoted to being a rook-pawn. A rook-pawn
can move like a rook, as well as being able to capture like a pawn. It is able to castle like a normal rook, but
cannot do en passant. The rook-pawn is normally signaled by placing a pawn on top of the rook.

5. Teleport: Once per game, each player may teleport their king to any empty square on the board which is not
in check. The king cannot teleport out of check or stalemate (if the only valid move a player has is to teleport
their king, then the game ends in a stalemate).

6. Fort A player may cast fort on their own king if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:
    • The king is not on the boundary of the board;
    • In the 8 squares surrounding the king, only pawns of the king’s colour can be found, and there is at least
    one alive pawn there;
    • Each pawn of the king’s colour is either dead or in one of the 8 squares surrounding the king.
    When the king casts fort, all dead pawns of the king’s colour are revived and placed around the king, so that
    the king is surrounded by the 8 pawns of it’s colour. After fort has been cast, the player in question cannot
    cast fort again for the rest of the game. If the king was one square away from the opponent’s backline when
    fort was cast, the 3 forted pawns on the opponents backline are immediately promoted.

7. Stargate: Consider the rectangle formed by two distinct pawns of the same colour. If stargate is cast on these
pieces, all pieces of both colours inside the rectangle (not including the boundary) are instantly vapourized,
except any kings. Stargate cannot be cast if any pieces are on the boundary of the rectangle, besides the
pawns casting stargate. Stargate also cannot be cast if the opponent’s king is inside the stargated region, or
if the stargated area is empty or only contains the king of the player casting stargate.


Game Notation
    • Standard algebraic notation is used for classic chess moves
    • For knight explosions, use the notation “N”+knight location+“xx”. For example, exploding the knight on
    square d4 is writted Nd4xx.
    • For queen explosions, use the notation “Q”+queen location+“xx”+line exploding
    – if exploding a file, use the file letter;
    – if exploding a rank, use the rank number;
    – if exploding a diagonal, use + for if it travels from the bottom left to top right (slope +1), and - for top
    left to bottom right (slope -1).
    For example, the queen on b2 exploding the diagonal from a1 to h8 is denoted “Qb2xx+”.
    • For a bishop shooting a pawn/knight, use the notation “B”+bishop location+“xx”+location of piece being
    shot. For example, a bishop on e3 shooting a pawn on f4 is denoted “Be3xxf4”.
    • A rook casting pawnify is denoted “R”+rook location+“+”. For example, a rook on a1 casting pawnify is
    denoted “Ra1+”.
    • A rookpawn is given the code “RP”
    • A king casting teleport is denoted “K”+“>”+new location. For example, a king on a1 teleporting to h1 is
    denoted “K>h1“.
    • A king casting fort is denoted “[K]”.
    • A stargate is denoted by pawn 1 location+“<>”+pawn 2 location, where we use the pawn with the leftmost
    file first. For example, pawns on a3 and g5 casting stargate is denoted “a3<>g5”.
